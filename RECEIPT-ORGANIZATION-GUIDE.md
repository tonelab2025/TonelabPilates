# Receipt File Organization System  

## ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Organized File Structure (August 14, 2025)

**Status: ACTIVE & WORKING**

### Current Storage Architecture:

**IMPORTANT: Files are stored in Google Cloud Storage (not Google Drive)**

```
Google Cloud Storage Bucket: repl-objstore-798bdcde-83a6-4d6a-8a3e-1fca29ce500a
└── .private/
    └── uploads/
        ├── 2025-08-14/

        │   ├── debug-trace-999_1755176063965                       ← Test file
        │   └── [other organized files...]
        ├── [old random files still accessible]
        │   ├── bc8eb8e7-37c5-495c-bf7e-6529ad80b00b              ← Soumik's receipt
        │   └── [other UUID files...]
        └── [future dates...]
```

**Why you don't see folders in Google Drive:**
- Receipt files are in Google Cloud Storage (Replit's object storage)
- Google Drive only contains your Google Sheets for booking data
- Files are accessible via your website: `/objects/uploads/2025-08-14/[filename]`

### File Naming Convention:
- **Format:** `[booking-id]_[timestamp]`
- **Example:** `08fc1e50-d5da-4f6e-8e43-f25f9f3e227a_1755175640123`
- **Folder:** `uploads/YYYY-MM-DD/`

### Reference System:
1. **Booking ID:** `08fc1e50-d5da-4f6e-8e43-f25f9f3e227a`
2. **Receipt Path:** `/objects/uploads/2025-08-14/08fc1e50-d5da-4f6e-8e43-f25f9f3e227a_1755175640123`
3. **Google Sheets:** Stores the normalized path
4. **File Access:** `https://your-site.com/objects/uploads/2025-08-14/[filename]`

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Day-wise Organization:** Easy to find receipts by date
- ✅ **Booking ID Reference:** Direct connection between booking and receipt
- ✅ **Timestamp Suffix:** Prevents file collisions
- ✅ **Admin Friendly:** Clear folder structure for management
- ✅ **Scalable:** Handles unlimited bookings per day

### Migration Status:
- **Existing Files:** Previous random UUID files remain accessible
- **New System:** All new uploads use organized structure 
- **Backward Compatible:** Old receipt URLs continue working
- **Google Sheets:** Updated to store new organized paths

### Current Test Data:

**Old Random System (Still accessible):**
- **Booking:** `08fc1e50-d5da-4f6e-8e43-f25f9f3e227a` (Soumik Sarkar)  
- **Receipt:** `/objects/uploads/bc8eb8e7-37c5-495c-bf7e-6529ad80b00b`
- **Status:** ✅ Working, referenced in Google Sheet

**NEW Organized System (Active):**
- **Booking:** `46566548-b2cc-4c50-8b2f-894e6fadf948` (Organized Storage Test)
- **Expected Receipt:** `/objects/uploads/2025-08-14/test-organized-storage-123_[timestamp]`
- **Status:** ✅ System ready - upload URL generation working with organized paths

**Live System Status (Latest Test: Tiyron Byre):**
- ✅ Backend: Organized folder structure ACTIVE and working
- ✅ Frontend: Generating proper booking IDs for file organization  
- ✅ Google Sheets: All bookings saving successfully with organized paths
- ✅ File Organization: `/uploads/2025-08-14/da267814-cbc9-426a-b05f-094654f583d9_1755176406835`
- ✅ File Access: Available via `/objects/uploads/2025-08-14/[filename]` endpoint

**Important:** Files are in Google Cloud Storage, not Google Drive. Google Drive only contains your Google Sheets with booking data.
