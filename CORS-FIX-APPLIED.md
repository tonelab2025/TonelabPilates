# CORS and API Routing Fix Applied

## Issue Resolved
The JSON parsing error was caused by CORS middleware being applied after routes, preventing API calls from working properly.

## Fix Applied
1. **Moved CORS middleware to the top** - Now applied before all routes
2. **Proper middleware ordering** - CORS → body parsing → routes → error handling
3. **Enhanced debugging** - Added catch-all route for better error messages

## Root Cause
The frontend at https://tonelabs.netlify.app/ was making API calls to `/api/content/public` but:
- CORS headers weren't being set properly (middleware order issue)
- This caused the API to return HTML error pages instead of JSON
- Frontend tried to parse HTML as JSON, causing the "Unexpected token '<'" error

## Expected Result After Deployment
- API calls will now work properly with CORS headers
- `/api/content/public` will return JSON content data
- Upload endpoints will function correctly  
- Console errors will be resolved

## Next Steps
1. Commit this CORS fix to GitHub
2. Redeploy on Netlify
3. Test the site - console errors should disappear
4. Verify content loads and file uploads work

The site should now be fully functional without any console errors.
