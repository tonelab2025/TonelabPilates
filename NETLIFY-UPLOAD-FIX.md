# Netlify Upload System Fix

## Issue Identified
Site deployed successfully at https://tonelabs.netlify.app/ but receipt upload failing due to missing API endpoints.

## Solution Applied
Added missing API endpoints to the minimal Netlify function:

### New Endpoints Added
1. **POST /api/upload/receipt** - Handles file uploads
2. **GET /api/upload/config** - Provides upload configuration  
3. **GET /api/admin/stats** - Admin dashboard statistics

### Enhanced Email Notifications
- Improved email formatting with booking details
- Better error handling for Web3Forms integration
- Structured email content for collective.tonelab@gmail.com

## Current Status
- âœ… Site loads: https://tonelabs.netlify.app/
- âœ… Booking form functional
- âœ… Email notifications working
- âœ… Admin dashboard accessible
- ðŸ”„ File upload endpoints added (commit and redeploy needed)

## Next Steps
1. Commit these API fixes to GitHub
2. Redeploy on Netlify
3. Test complete booking flow with receipt upload

The minimal function approach ensures fast deployment while maintaining all core functionality.
