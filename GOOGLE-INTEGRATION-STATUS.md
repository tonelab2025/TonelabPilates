# Google Integration Status & File Storage Guide

## ✅ How to Check Google Sheets Propagation Status

### Method 1: Quick API Test
```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:5000/api/debug/test-sheets"
```

**Responses:**
- `"status": "READY"` ✅ → Google Sheets sync working!
- `"status": "PROPAGATING"` ⏳ → Still waiting (normal, can take 30 mins)
- `"status": "ERROR"` ❌ → Configuration issue

### Method 2: Check Your Google Sheet
Visit: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XNcktdtttVYDnXwCHg_4te51ym60V9XBovU8j_Bo55w/edit

**Expected Result:**
- New bookings appear automatically in rows 2, 3, 4...
- Headers in Row 1: `Booking ID | Timestamp | Full Name | Email | Phone | Receipt URL | Early Bird | Policy Accepted`

### Method 3: Make a Test Booking
- Create a booking through your website
- Check local admin dashboard (immediate)
- Check Google Sheet (when ready)
