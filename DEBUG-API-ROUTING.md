# API Routing Debug Fix

## Issue
Console error: "Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON"
This means API calls are getting HTML (404 pages) instead of JSON responses.

## Root Cause
Frontend making API calls to endpoints that aren't properly routed in the Netlify function.

## Fix Applied
1. **Added CORS headers** - Ensures API calls work from the frontend
2. **Added error handling** - Better debugging when endpoints aren't found  
3. **Added catch-all route** - Shows available endpoints when 404 occurs
4. **Enhanced error logging** - Helps identify routing issues

## Debug Info Added
The API now returns helpful error messages showing:
- What endpoint was requested
- List of all available endpoints
- Proper JSON error responses instead of HTML

## Next Steps
1. Commit this fix to GitHub
2. Redeploy on Netlify
3. Check browser console - errors should now be clearer JSON responses
4. Verify which specific endpoint is failing

This will resolve the JSON parsing error and show exactly which API call is failing.
