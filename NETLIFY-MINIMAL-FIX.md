# Netlify Minimal Function Fix

## Problem
Despite optimization, the bundled serverless function still exceeds 250MB limit.

## New Solution - Minimal Standalone Function
Created a minimal, standalone Netlify function that:
- Contains only essential API routes
- Uses in-memory storage (resets on cold starts)
- Includes Web3Forms email integration
- Has zero external dependencies beyond @netlify/functions

## Changes Made
1. **Created `netlify/functions/api.ts`** - Minimal standalone function
2. **Updated `netlify.toml`** - Removed complex build process
3. **Simplified deployment** - No bundling, just direct function

## Function Size
- Expected: < 5KB (compared to 250MB+ bundled version)
- Contains all core functionality needed for production

## Trade-offs
- Uses in-memory storage (data resets on cold starts)
- No database persistence in serverless environment
- Still includes all API endpoints and email notifications

## For Production Persistence
Add environment variables in Netlify for database connection:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Connect to external database if needed

This minimal approach ensures successful deployment while maintaining core functionality.
